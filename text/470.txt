Undergraduates seeking renewal of grants, work, or loans from Federal, State, or Rensselaer sources must complete the 2022-23 Renewal Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).    Graduate students seeking renewal of their Federal Direct Loan or Federal Grad PLUS Loan eligibility must also file a Renewal FAFSA.  Students seeking to renew only their Rensselaer merit scholarship funding are not required to file the FAFSA.
