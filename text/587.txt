By John Christian, Ph.D., assistant professor of mechanical, aerospace, and nuclear engineering and director of the Sensing, Estimation, and Automation LaboratoryDespite centuries of study, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the Earth. Part of the problem is that, until the beginning of the Space Age in the 1950s, all of our observations of Earth were from sensors on, or very near, the planet’s surface. The utility of space for gaining a better understanding of the natural world was apparent from the beginning, and many of the earliest spacecraft had mission objectives related to Earth or space science.Understanding more about Earth is critical as we face global challenges like climate change and a growing population’s demand for food, fresh water, and energy. Modern space exploration benefits from understanding Earth in two important ways. First is space-based observation of the Earth itself, which provides measurements used for everything from weather forecasting to commercial agriculture to climate monitoring.Second, and perhaps less obvious, is the observation of other planets and moons. It may seem strange, but improving our understanding of far-away places where no human has ever been can teach us a lot about Earth. Specifically, we find that one of the best ways to learn about the processes underway on Earth is to observe what is happening elsewhere, an endeavor often called comparative planetology. These other bodies often exhibit certain phenomena more prominently than what we see on Earth, allowing us an opportunity to more easily understand how they work. The study of the atmosphere of Venus, for example, was critical to our current understanding of both the “greenhouse effect” and the devastating effect of CFCs on the ozone in Earth’s atmosphere.
