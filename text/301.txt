About the Private Music Lessons ProgramThe Rensselaer Music Program began offering private lessons in instrumental and vocal performance in 2016, and grew into the Private Music Lessons Program from a renewed emphasis on music studies spearheaded by Dean Mary Simoni, Ph.D. A unique Bachelor of Science in Music launched one year later, which combines depth in traditional and contemporary music skills with a breadth in media, engineering and science.The Private Music Lessons Program is open to all Rensselaer students, and is offered for academic credit.

Student Testimonials  










"I am very grateful to be taking private lessons with Prof. Morey at RPI and I hope to continue studying the violin during my time at Rensselaer. Whether you are first starting out on an instrument or working to hone your technique and grow as a musician, I believe that there’s nothing quite like private lessons, where the teacher’s primary focus is on helping you."





 

Sarah Shiang ’23
Violin Student Science, Technology, & Society (Accelerated Law) Major















"Prior to my private vocal lessons, I was mostly self-taught, beyond the advice of musical directors during rehearsals. I held my own in musical auditions mostly based on instinct, but I knew I had issues transitioning between chest and head voices, and that I really only had one type of music in my repertoire. Working with Elissa significantly helped me in those areas."



 

Matthew Fields ’18
Voice Student  Materials Engineering Major



























Lessons are taught by part-time instructors employed as “Faculty Fellows” who deliver one-on-one instruction in violin, viola, cello, bass, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba, piano, harp, percussion, voice, guitar, and jazz improvisation. These Faculty Fellows are recruited from the ranks of leading music professionals in the Capital District.

On occasion, showcase concerts are presented in the Experimental Media and Performing Art Center (EMPAC).

Student Testimonials  










"I am very grateful to be taking private lessons with Prof. Morey at RPI and I hope to continue studying the violin during my time at Rensselaer. Whether you are first starting out on an instrument or working to hone your technique and grow as a musician, I believe that there’s nothing quite like private lessons, where the teacher’s primary focus is on helping you."

Violin Student Science, Technology, & Society (Accelerated Law) Major















"Prior to my private vocal lessons, I was mostly self-taught, beyond the advice of musical directors during rehearsals. I held my own in musical auditions mostly based on instinct, but I knew I had issues transitioning between chest and head voices, and that I really only had one type of music in my repertoire. Working with Elissa significantly helped me in those areas."

About the Private Music Lessons ProgramThe Rensselaer Music Program began offering private lessons in instrumental and vocal performance in 2016, and grew into the Private Music Lessons Program from a renewed emphasis on music studies spearheaded by Dean Mary Simoni, Ph.D. A unique Bachelor of Science in Music launched one year later, which combines depth in traditional and contemporary music skills with a breadth in media, engineering and science.The Private Music Lessons Program is open to all Rensselaer students, and is offered for academic credit. Music majors and minors may apply the credit earned in the Private Music Lessons Program to their degrees. Non-majors or minors can participate in this program as part of their HASS elective coursework.
