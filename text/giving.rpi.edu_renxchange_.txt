RenXchange is a calling program that consists of student representatives who serve as liaisons between the Institute and its alumni, alumnae, parents, and the community. The program employs students to work on campus each semester, and allows them the opportunity to connect with the Rensselaer community. A RenXchange student’s primary task is to explain the importance of the Annual Fund and other key initiatives in enhancing the quality of a student’s Rensselaer education, ask alumni and parents to support the Annual Fund, and inform them about Institute news and updates. RenXchange students serve as ambassadors, informing the Rensselaer community about Giving Days and other special Annual Giving fundraising initiatives occurring throughout the year.During “non-pandemic” times, approximately 20-25 students meet on campus each night throughout the semester, and are assigned their own work stations to make phone calls in support of these initiatives. RenXchange students also have hosted tables in the Student Union during special giving days like Rπ Day to further promote awareness of the Annual Fund and student philanthropy. Due to the pandemic, Rensselaer has had to make adjustments to this program for the safety of our student staff. Currently, RenXchange is only able to accommodate 12 students calling per night, reducing callers by half. These student employees receive COVID-19 tests twice a week at the testing site on campus, regardless if they live on or off campus, and remain masked at all times. Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer is available at each of their stations, and each station is sanitized before and after every use.If you have ever received a phone call from a Rensselaer student, most likely that student was part of the RenXchange program. RenXchange student representatives serve as liaisons between the Institute and its alumni, alumnae, parents and the community. The program employs students to work on campus, and allows them the opportunity to connect with the Rensselaer community. Many students enjoy reaching out to and having meaningful conversations with alumni, alumnae and parents who have a shared connection with Rensselaer.Meet the Student RenXchange TeamRenXchange students come from all over the country and across the globe and are majoring in programs across the five schools.Haroon Abukar ’24CallerMonika Dabrowska ’23CallerGabriella Giancola ’21 CallerMatthew Glanz ’23 CallerNicole Gramenides ’23 CallerAlvah Higginson ’22 SupervisorZoe Hyres-Buley ’23 CallerMauricio Ibarra-Towle ’23 CallerJames Leibring ’23CallerSaskia Leishman ’24CallerAngela Lopez ’22 CallerEmmet Mayer ’23 CallerCora Nelson ’22 CallerNate Nelson ’23 SupervisorDeen Ninche ’23 CallerEvelyn Pae ’22 CallerSamantha Trybus ’23 CallerPreston Waters ’24 SupervisorChasan Building
