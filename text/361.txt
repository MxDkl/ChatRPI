Supporting Fraternities and Sororities:
How You Can Help
 




Founded in 1853, the fraternity and sorority system at Rensselaer is one of the first to be established on a university campus in the United States. We are proud to continue to celebrate this rich heritage and more than 160 years of value and tradition. There are many ways that you can support current and future generations of students continuing the tradition of Greek Life at Rensselaer. 












 





ROGER MIKE ’70 





Delta Phi Fraternity Board MemberChapter Advisor Emeritus 











“The friendships that are at the core of fraternities and sororities grow deeper over time until one day, as with me, you are in your 70s and your brothers continue to mean more and more to you. The bonds don’t dissipate over time; to the contrary, they become stronger and one day you realize that, yes, this will last my entire life. That’s a gift.”

“The friendships that are at the core of fraternities and sororities grow deeper over time until one day, as with me, you are in your 70s and your brothers continue to mean more and more to you. The bonds don’t dissipate over time; to the contrary, they become stronger and one day you realize that, yes, this will last my entire life. That’s a gift.”
