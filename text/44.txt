Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute The Rensselaer Health Informatics Challenges in Technology Education (INCITE) Pipeline recruits and prepares students at Rensselaer and worldwide to be data scientists in healthcare using early data analytics courses and experiential research projects centered on real-world health challenges.With the advent of electronic healthcare records (EHR) and precision medicine, healthcare increasingly relies on health informatics (HI), the philosophy and tools of data science (DS) and their application in healthcare. Rensselaer Health INCITE is a innovative, replicable program that directly expands the health informatics workforce pipeline at the early undergraduate level for students at RPI and worldwide. Health INCITE addresses key challenges in attracting and training top talent:Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Data INCITE pipeline for undergraduate data science education consists of an early data analytics course followed by applied data science research experiences on real-world problems. Data INCITE results in data science skills and prompts students to pursue further coursework and careers in data science. Health INCITE builds on Data INCITE, providing a similar pipeline to recruit and train data scientists for health informatics careers.The Rensselaer Health INCITE Pipeline:The Rensselaer Health INCITE Pipeline has been generously funded by the United Health FoundationCheck out the Project Gallery to see research products (interactive apps, papers, and presentations) created by Health INCITE students in the Data INCITE Lab. Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA)
