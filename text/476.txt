RENSSELAER POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTEFor many programs, admissions are so competitive that students find themselves choosing to take a gap year, one or more years between undergraduate graduation and medical school matriculation. These gap years are useful for students who need to address weak areas in their application, who wish to experience additional opportunities outside of higher education before continuing their education, or who wish to take advantage of opportunities to engage in research.There is no single applicant that should take a gap year and no applicant who shouldn't. Ultimately, choosing to take a gap year is a complicated decision that is based not only on your own circumstances but also on your goals.

Some students choose to pursue coursework independently, in order to address weak areas in their academic preparation. Others choose to pursue a Master's degree in a related field, such as Biology or Public Health. At Rensselaer, we offer the co-terminal program, which is a popular program for students considering medical school. It allows students to pursue a master's degree in a single year, immediately after finishing their undergraduate education.In addition to these programs, there are more formalized programs. These programs are formalized pathways to medical school designed by colleges, often in tandem with medical school admissions. These programs are broadly called academic record enhancer programs, for students who may have struggled to do well on the MCAT or in undergraduate pre-requisites for medical school.
