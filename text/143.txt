Giving back is a time-honored tradition at Rensselaer, culminating in the class gift during senior year.  Whether you are in your first year or a graduating senior, you can help create a legacy of philanthropy during your four years at Rensselaer.
The following programs illustrate the many ways in which Rensselaer students show their support and answering the question “why not change the world?”
The Senior Class Gift
As you make preparations to leave the campus you called home since freshman year, show your pride as a member of the senior class through your support of the senior class gift.
Previous class gifts have included grants for incoming freshmen to attend Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond programming, and support for weR Gold, our student-powered crowdfunding initiative.
Become a Young Patroon
For those interested in making more of an impact on their class gift, seniors who contribute $100 or more will become members of the prestigious Annual Patroon Society at Rensselaer.  As a leader among your peers, you will receive an invitation to attend the annual Patroon Brunch during Reunion & Homecoming Weekend. This event is a fantastic opportunity to meet and network with the accomplished and generous alumni and alumnae of Rensselaer!
RenXchange
RenXchange gives students the chance to contact alumni from a range of class years, talk with them about their days at Rensselaer, and ask them for their support of the Rensselaer Annual Fund.
Our scheduling is flexible and easy, broken into a minimum of three two hour shifts that are chosen by employees weekly. With shifts available Sunday afternoons, evenings from Monday through Thursday, as well as Friday afternoons, there are many opportunities to work while still accommodating extra-curricular activities and academics.
For more information, contact:Office of Annual Giving(518) 276-6055

weR Gold
A gift to weR Gold is unique because it allows you to have a direct and immediate impact on student groups around campus. Clubs and organizations are essential to the Rensselaer student experience. In addition to fostering teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving, these groups allow students to have a “real-world” impact, which is what a Rensselaer education is all about.

Giving back is a time-honored tradition at Rensselaer, culminating in the class gift during senior year.  Whether you are in your first year or a graduating senior, you can help create a legacy of philanthropy during your four years at Rensselaer.
The following programs illustrate the many ways in which Rensselaer students show their support and answering the question “why not change the world?”
The Senior Class Gift
As you make preparations to leave the campus you called home since freshman year, show your pride as a member of the senior class through your support of the senior class gift.
Previous class gifts have included grants for incoming freshmen to attend Navigating Rensselaer and Beyond programming, and support for weR Gold, our student-powered crowdfunding initiative.
Become a Young Patroon
For those interested in making more of an impact on their class gift, seniors who contribute $100 or more will become members of the prestigious Annual Patroon Society at Rensselaer.  As a leader among your peers, you will receive an invitation to attend the annual Patroon Brunch during Reunion & Homecoming Weekend. This event is a fantastic opportunity to meet and network with the accomplished and generous alumni and alumnae of Rensselaer!
RenXchange
RenXchange gives students the chance to contact alumni from a range of class years, talk with them about their days at Rensselaer, and ask them for their support of the Rensselaer Annual Fund.
Our scheduling is flexible and easy, broken into a minimum of three two hour shifts that are chosen by employees weekly. With shifts available Sunday afternoons, evenings from Monday through Thursday, as well as Friday afternoons, there are many opportunities to work while still accommodating extra-curricular activities and academics.
