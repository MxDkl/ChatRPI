The truth is that most Rensselaer students receive support, thanks to financial aid. So instead of looking at the published price, concentrate on your net price — the real price you’ll pay for a college.
What Is Net Price?
The net price, on average, is considerably lower than the published price. If you thought a Rensselaer eduction was out of reach, it may turn out to be affordable.
What Is a Net Price Calculator?
A net price calculator is a free online tool that gives you a personalized estimate of net price. The federal government now requires most colleges and universities to have a net price calculator on their websites.
How Do Net Price Calculators Work?
The net price calculator will ask you questions about your family’s finances and may also ask you questions about your GPA, test scores, activities and other things that may qualify you for financial aid. It uses your answers to figure out how much money in grants and scholarships Rensselaer is likely to award you, then subtracts that number from the full cost of attendance to estimate how much the college might really cost you.
Why Are Net Price Calculators Important?
By providing personalized estimates, net price calculators offer you a more informed way of deciding if Rensselaer is within reach. Knowing your net price:
Gives you the best idea of what you’ll pay
Makes comparing colleges easier
Widens your choice of colleges
Also, different students get different amounts of gift aid. That’s where a net price calculator comes in — it figures out what gift aid you might be eligible for.

The truth is that most Rensselaer students receive support, thanks to financial aid. So instead of looking at the published price, concentrate on your net price — the real price you’ll pay for a college.
What Is Net Price?
The net price, on average, is considerably lower than the published price. If you thought a Rensselaer eduction was out of reach, it may turn out to be affordable.
What Is a Net Price Calculator?
A net price calculator is a free online tool that gives you a personalized estimate of net price. The federal government now requires most colleges and universities to have a net price calculator on their websites.
How Do Net Price Calculators Work?
The net price calculator will ask you questions about your family’s finances and may also ask you questions about your GPA, test scores, activities and other things that may qualify you for financial aid. It uses your answers to figure out how much money in grants and scholarships Rensselaer is likely to award you, then subtracts that number from the full cost of attendance to estimate how much the college might really cost you.
Why Are Net Price Calculators Important?
By providing personalized estimates, net price calculators offer you a more informed way of deciding if Rensselaer is within reach. Knowing your net price:
Gives you the best idea of what you’ll pay
Makes comparing colleges easier
Widens your choice of colleges
Also, different students get different amounts of gift aid. That’s where a net price calculator comes in — it figures out what gift aid you might be eligible for.

     Net Price Calculator     

The truth is that most Rensselaer students receive support, thanks to financial aid. So instead of looking at the published price, concentrate on your net price — the real price you’ll pay for a college.
What Is Net Price?
The net price, on average, is considerably lower than the published price. If you thought a Rensselaer eduction was out of reach, it may turn out to be affordable.
What Is a Net Price Calculator?
A net price calculator is a free online tool that gives you a personalized estimate of net price. The federal government now requires most colleges and universities to have a net price calculator on their websites.
How Do Net Price Calculators Work?
The net price calculator will ask you questions about your family’s finances and may also ask you questions about your GPA, test scores, activities and other things that may qualify you for financial aid. It uses your answers to figure out how much money in grants and scholarships Rensselaer is likely to award you, then subtracts that number from the full cost of attendance to estimate how much the college might really cost you.
Why Are Net Price Calculators Important?
By providing personalized estimates, net price calculators offer you a more informed way of deciding if Rensselaer is within reach. Knowing your net price:
Gives you the best idea of what you’ll pay
Makes comparing colleges easier
Widens your choice of colleges
Also, different students get different amounts of gift aid. That’s where a net price calculator comes in — it figures out what gift aid you might be eligible for.

     Net Price Calculator     

The truth is that most Rensselaer students receive support, thanks to financial aid. So instead of looking at the published price, concentrate on your net price — the real price you’ll pay for a college.
What Is Net Price?
The net price, on average, is considerably lower than the published price. If you thought a Rensselaer eduction was out of reach, it may turn out to be affordable.
What Is a Net Price Calculator?
A net price calculator is a free online tool that gives you a personalized estimate of net price. The federal government now requires most colleges and universities to have a net price calculator on their websites.
How Do Net Price Calculators Work?
The net price calculator will ask you questions about your family’s finances and may also ask you questions about your GPA, test scores, activities and other things that may qualify you for financial aid. It uses your answers to figure out how much money in grants and scholarships Rensselaer is likely to award you, then subtracts that number from the full cost of attendance to estimate how much the college might really cost you.
Why Are Net Price Calculators Important?
By providing personalized estimates, net price calculators offer you a more informed way of deciding if Rensselaer is within reach. Knowing your net price:
Gives you the best idea of what you’ll pay
Makes comparing colleges easier
