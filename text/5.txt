Rensselaer Polytechnic InstituteRPI StudySafe is an app that reveals the anonymous usage of Wi-Fi access points and aggregations of wireless users on the campus network at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York. Analysis and visualizations are by students and staff of The Rensselaer Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA). This is an app associated with the COVID-19 contact tracing and campus network mapping projects.RPI StudySafe is designed to present WAP data to on-campus users so they can make informed decisions on where to go for extended periods of time on campus. The data can be interacted with in several ways, including selecting certain dates, times, locations, as well as through interactive geographical maps. Geographic location and density of each WAP are combined by building, and the data is updated every two hours.Institute for Data Exploration and Applications (IDEA)
