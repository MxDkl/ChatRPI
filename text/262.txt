     DACA & DREAMer Students     

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) & DREAMer students should follow the application instructions for an international applicant. Detailed instructions may be found above. At Rensselaer, our definitions of domestic versus international, as far as the application process goes, are aligned with the federal government’s definitions of eligibility for federal financial aid (versus residency, for example). So, without U.S. citizenship or a green card, a student would be considered an international applicant versus a domestic applicant.   
How should DACA & DREAMer students indicate citizenship status on the application?
For the question, "Select your citizenship status," please choose  "DACA, undocumented, Deferred Enforced Departure, or Temporary Protected Status".
What is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?
DACA is an American immigration policy that allows certain undocumented immigrants who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 to receive a renewable two-year work permit and exemption from deportation.
Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

     DACA & DREAMer Students     

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) & DREAMer students should follow the application instructions for an international applicant. Detailed instructions may be found above. At Rensselaer, our definitions of domestic versus international, as far as the application process goes, are aligned with the federal government’s definitions of eligibility for federal financial aid (versus residency, for example). So, without U.S. citizenship or a green card, a student would be considered an international applicant versus a domestic applicant.   
How should DACA & DREAMer students indicate citizenship status on the application?
For the question, "Select your citizenship status," please choose  "DACA, undocumented, Deferred Enforced Departure, or Temporary Protected Status".
What is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?
DACA is an American immigration policy that allows certain undocumented immigrants who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 to receive a renewable two-year work permit and exemption from deportation.

So, without U.S. citizenship or a green card, a student would be considered an international applicant versus a domestic applicant.   
How should DACA & DREAMer students indicate citizenship status on the application?
For the question, "Select your citizenship status," please choose  "DACA, undocumented, Deferred Enforced Departure, or Temporary Protected Status".
What is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?

     DACA & DREAMer Students     

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) & DREAMer students should follow the application instructions for an international applicant. Detailed instructions may be found above. At Rensselaer, our definitions of domestic versus international, as far as the application process goes, are aligned with the federal government’s definitions of eligibility for federal financial aid (versus residency, for example). So, without U.S. citizenship or a green card, a student would be considered an international applicant versus a domestic applicant.   
How should DACA & DREAMer students indicate citizenship status on the application?
For the question, "Select your citizenship status," please choose  "DACA, undocumented, Deferred Enforced Departure, or Temporary Protected Status".
What is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?
DACA is an American immigration policy that allows certain undocumented immigrants who entered the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 to receive a renewable two-year work permit and exemption from deportation.
