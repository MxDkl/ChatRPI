Outstanding educational quality is the hallmark of an RPI degree. Education is at the very core of our mission as an institute, and has been ever since its founding. Moreover, undergraduate tuition is the largest revenue driver on our pie chart. Exceptional research is also part of the allure to RPI. Students are quite proud that world-changing, cutting-edge research happens here everyday; and they are often excited to be part of it as URPs!

Mental Health Awareness

Considering how rigorous RPI is prided for being, resources for mental health are not always very accessible. I think increased awareness about how students can find counseling and all of the options they have would be very important to ensuring student success.
