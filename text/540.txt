NUCLEAR ENGINEERING at RPIRensselaer launched its plan for NE research in the late 1950s when the Atomic Energy Commission funded a project to construct a linear electron accelerator in 1958.  The NE Department was officially formed in 1960 and is one of the oldest such programs in the U.S.  The construction of the accelerator facility was completed in 1961 and the facility would soon be named after Professor Gaerttner who was instrumental in establishing NE at Rensselaer and who served as NE’s first departmental head.   Within a few years, the NE Department at Rensselaer awarded its first PhD degrees and then B.S. degrees.
                At Rensselaer, concentrations are available in fission reactor physics, reactor engineering, health physics, thermal-hydraulics, reliability and safety, and fusion engineering. Boasting unique and state-of-the-art research facilities, Rensselaer students have access to a critical reactor, a large electron accelerator, and modern computer interfacing technology. With today's need for inexpensive sources of energy, Rensselaer nuclear engineering graduates are in great demand for positions in industry or graduate study. Additionally, there are exciting possibilities in space power propulsion, fusion reactor engineering, medicine, and national defense. Graduate Teaching and Research Assistantships in Nuclear Engineering are available. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute invites applications for teaching and research assistantships leading to PhD degrees in nuclear engineering and science. As the oldest engineering school in the U.S., RPI has a long history in nuclear engineering education and its top ranked nuclear engineering program covers nuclear fission and fusion engineering, electron accelerator physics and neutron physics, multiphase flow and reactor safety analysis, nuclear materials and fuel cycle, homeland security, and health/medical physics. For additional information, please visit the Contact link. RPI's nuclear engineering program is one of the programs in the U.S. that are qualified for DOE scholarships and fellowships. Scholarship recipients receive $7,500 toward the cost of their education. They are eligible to apply for the scholarship in subsequent years. Fellowship winners will receive $50,000 a year over the next three years to help pay for their graduate studies and research, plus $5,000 toward a summer internship. The Nuclear Engineering Program is proud to announce that we will award 8 students to receive 2022 NRC Nuclear Excellence Scholarship/Award. The scholarship will be $7000 toward recipients’ tuition in either Fall 2022 or Spring 2023 semester (the recipient will choose a semester to use, or split between two semesters). Previous recipients are welcome to apply again. The basic criteria for a possible recipient are:
              
be US Citizen or Permanent Resident;
your major must be Nuclear Engineering (it is OK to be dual major or you are in transition to Nuclear Engineering;
The scholarship is only for undergraduate education, which means you will graduate on or after December 2022; and
maintain GPA at or above 3.3 (for very special student, we can consider lower GPA requirement).

              If you wish to nominate one of your fellow friends/students/classmates or yourself, please send to Professor Liu liue@rpi.edu the filled nomination form and the resume of the nominee. Any questions, please contact Professor Liu.  The due date is 9/5/2022.
