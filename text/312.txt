The Garnet D. Baltimore Endowed Scholarship





Garnet Douglass Baltimore
Garnet Douglass Baltimore, a member of the Class of 1881—a distinguished civil and landscape engineer—and the first African American to graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He was the grandson of a slave who fought in the Revolutionary war, and eventually escaped, settling in Troy, and the son of an influential abolitionist.
Garnet Baltimore was the embodiment of a Rensselaer graduate—working on the design and construction of bridges, railroads, roads, and waterways. His professional legacy includes Troy’s Prospect Park and Oakwood Cemetery, the resting place of Samuel Wilson, or “Uncle Sam.” Intensely proud of his Rensselaer education, Baltimore remained active in civic activities and alumni affairs and was inducted into the Rensselaer Alumni Hall of Fame in 2005.
The Garnet D. Baltimore Endowed Scholarship has been established at Rensselaer in response to the need for scholarships for students from underrepresented groups—including African American students and women— for generations to come.
