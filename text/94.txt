The power to make a difference in the lives of our students is fully realized through the Patroon Scholars Program of the Rensselaer Annual Fund. Since 1995, the Patroon Scholars Program has provided vital scholarship dollars for more than 300 talented Rensselaer students. Rensselaer offers the prestigious Patroon Scholarship only to candidates with strong academic achievement along with demonstrated leadership, service and community involvement.With an annual gift of $10,000 per year for four (or five*) consecutive years, a scholarship is created in your name, and awarded to an incoming qualified freshman. As the student progresses each year, the scholarship offers an incentive to maintain excellence and builds the type of relationship between the sponsor and student that lasts a lifetime. (*for School of Architecture students)Supporters of this program are encouraged to meet their students throughout the year, particularly at the annual Patroon and Donor Recognition Brunch, and many have developed lasting relationships over the years. In addition to providing counsel to students, Patroon Scholar donors help to instill a culture of philanthropy at Rensselaer and inspire the next generation to give.In the video below, Patroon Scholar Zoe Anderson â€™17 provides her answer.Chasan Building
