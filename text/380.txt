Samantha Soevyn-Kreamer ’24










I am pursuing a dual major in biology and philosophy. I originally planned to study biology since I have always enjoyed the topic and the research. However, I fell in love with the philosophy department – they offer a variety of classes that allow a break from the structured science classes we all have to take. These classes are more discussion-based, and the professors allow for our thoughts and ideas to be considered as actual solutions.
RPI cares a lot about the success of its students. We have opportunities for hands-on research, as well as classes that are specific to the variety of interests of students like me. In fact, if there is an area that isn’t listed, they can help you set up an independent study for it! RPI also offers internships in the field you are studying to gain experience and to secure a job after graduation.
I am also so grateful for my Air Force ROTC opportunity. My dream has always been to serve in the military. Through ROTC, I can succeed in my future goals while also obtaining a degree. After graduation, I plan to commission into the United States Air Force as a biomedical laboratory technician or an RPA pilot.
Without the help of alumni, parents, families, and friends, I don’t think I could have attended RPI. I was able to go to my dream school, thanks to the scholarships I received. My time here at Rensselaer has been truly memorable, and I can’t wait to see what else is to come.
