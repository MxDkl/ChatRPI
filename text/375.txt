Victory Abraham ’24










I am so appreciative of the experience I have had as an RPI student! As a rising junior, I chose to major in business with a concentration in marketing and minor in strategic communications because it fits my personality and who I am. I am a people person who loves to communicate, and my time at RPI has prepared me well for new adventures and opportunities.
The financial assistance I received through my scholarship was so important, and I am truly grateful for everyone’s support. I think the best opportunity that I have is being a student-athlete and able to juggle my academics and participation on the football team. It has taught me so many life skills that I will use as a future RPI alumnus, including time management, being a leader, and being a better teammate both on and off the field.
I’m so grateful for the opportunities the scholarship has provided to me as a student. After I graduate, I plan to get my MBA, through the co-term program, which is another opportunity at RPI for me!
