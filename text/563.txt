Summer Financial Aid 






Note: Separate instructions and policies apply to the Arch Program.  The information and instructions below pertain to students who are taking summer courses, but not participating in the Arch Program. 
Federal Student Aid:  Federal financial aid for summer 2023 sessions can include Federal Direct/PLUS loans, Pell Grants, and Supplemental Grants (SEOG).  
About Federal Direct Loan Eligibility:   The Direct Loan program has annual loan maximums which are typically divided by the two standard terms of enrollment within each award year for our students.  If you use a portion of your Direct Loan(s) during the summer and plan to enroll for all three terms of an award year, you will have less available for the Fall and Spring Semesters than you may have realized in prior years.  This is because your annual maximum will be divided equally into three terms instead of two.  Your loans will be awarded to match your enrollment pattern indicated on your completed Summer Aid Application.
New York State Grants:  NYS grants such as TAP may be used in the summer if you will be accelerating your graduation date by taking summer classes or if you are enrolled for your Summer On-Campus for The Arch program.  TAP eligible students must request funding for the Summer Semester on their TAP application. For students not in The Arch, payment of summer TAP may be delayed by over a year due to NY State funding rules:  if this takes place your funds will be applied to your student account in October 2024.  This delay does not apply to The Arch Summer On-Campus.

About Federal Direct Loan Eligibility:   The Direct Loan program has annual loan maximums which are typically divided by the two standard terms of enrollment within each award year for our students.  If you use a portion of your Direct Loan(s) during the summer and plan to enroll for all three terms of an award year, you will have less available for the Fall and Spring Semesters than you may have realized in prior years.  This is because your annual maximum will be divided equally into three terms instead of two.  Your loans will be awarded to match your enrollment pattern indicated on your completed Summer Aid Application.
New York State Grants:  NYS grants such as TAP may be used in the summer if you will be accelerating your graduation date by taking summer classes or if you are enrolled for your Summer On-Campus for The Arch program.  TAP eligible students must request funding for the Summer Semester on their TAP application. For students not in The Arch, payment of summer TAP may be delayed by over a year due to NY State funding rules:  if this takes place your funds will be applied to your student account in October 2024.  This delay does not apply to The Arch Summer On-Campus.
Rensselaer Scholarships & Grants:  Students may utilize a semester of their eligibility for RPI scholarship and/or grant for Summer enrollment. Using RPI gift aid during the summer counts a full semester used out of the eight semesters (or ten if Architecture) of RPI gift aid a student is eligible to receive as an undergraduate.   For students enrolled part-time, these funds will be prorated based on the number of credits you take. You must take at least six credits to be eligible for RPI gift aid.
The proration formula for Rensselaer aid is:
