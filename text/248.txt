     Standardized Test Requirements      

Due to the recent suspension of SAT and ACT testing, any student who applies to attend Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an undergraduate in the fall of 2023 or the spring of 2023 will be able to choose whether or not to submit SAT or ACT scores. This is a continuation of the temporary suspension of our standardized testing requirement, and it will be re-evaluated for the Fall 2024 application cycle. Test-Optional FAQs
Due to Albany Medical College requirements, students applying to the Physician-Scientist Program will be required to submit the appropriate test scores (see below).
Standardized Testing Information:
SAT or ACT (If you take multiple tests, Rensselaer will superscore the SAT, but will consider only the highest composite score on the ACT.)
An English language proficiency examination is required for all non-native English speakers
If you do choose to submit your scores, Rensselaer allows most students to self-report SAT and ACT test scores on the application or through their application portal (available after an application is submitted). Students who choose to enroll at Rensselaer will be required to send their official scores from the testing agency (if they have not already done so). Enrolling students will be required to send official scores for any and all self-reported test scores they submitted in the application process. Students applying to the Physician-Scientist Program will be required to send official scores at the time of application (see below). Self-reported English proficiency exam scores will not be accepted.
All standardized tests must be taken by the December test date (by the November test date for Physician-Scientist Program applicants).

Updates Rensselaer’s Advanced Placement policy, starting Fall 2023:
Students entering as first-time freshmen in fall of 2023 may transfer a maximum of 32 credits hours toward their Bachelor’s degree at Rensselaer, of which only 28 credit hours may come from AP or IB courses.
Students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on an accepted exam may receive academic credit at Rensselaer excluding Math*, Science, Computer Science, or Statistics courses.
How the credits are applied to a student’s degree program depends on the student’s choice of major. Students may need to complete additional course work to fulfill the specific program requirements. The student should consult with their adviser for additional details.
At Student Orientation, department representatives will be available for questions.




      College Course Credit Policy
The Registrar will have courses evaluated by the appropriate departments on campus. An official transcript of grade(s) from the other college(s) must be sent to the Office of the Registrar to be considered for credit. The student’s file must include photocopies of course descriptions of all courses for which the student requests transfer credit consideration. No grade is given for transfer credit and it is not included in calculating the QPA. 
Transfer credit will not be given for any college courses taken while in high school if these courses were used in obtaining the high school diploma. Only a total of two courses, for a maximum of eight advanced placement and/or transfer credits, may be used toward the HASS core requirements for graduation. Only a total of two courses, for a maximum of eight transfer credits, may be used to satisfy the science core requirement. Any courses beyond two may be used toward free electives.

     Standardized Test Requirements      

Due to the recent suspension of SAT and ACT testing, any student who applies to attend Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute as an undergraduate in the fall of 2023 or the spring of 2023 will be able to choose whether or not to submit SAT or ACT scores. This is a continuation of the temporary suspension of our standardized testing requirement, and it will be re-evaluated for the Fall 2024 application cycle. Test-Optional FAQs
Due to Albany Medical College requirements, students applying to the Physician-Scientist Program will be required to submit the appropriate test scores (see below).
Standardized Testing Information:
SAT or ACT (If you take multiple tests, Rensselaer will superscore the SAT, but will consider only the highest composite score on the ACT.)
An English language proficiency examination is required for all non-native English speakers
If you do choose to submit your scores, Rensselaer allows most students to self-report SAT and ACT test scores on the application or through their application portal (available after an application is submitted). Students who choose to enroll at Rensselaer will be required to send their official scores from the testing agency (if they have not already done so). Enrolling students will be required to send official scores for any and all self-reported test scores they submitted in the application process. Students applying to the Physician-Scientist Program will be required to send official scores at the time of application (see below). Self-reported English proficiency exam scores will not be accepted.
All standardized tests must be taken by the December test date (by the November test date for Physician-Scientist Program applicants).




      Physician-Scientist Program (B.S./M.D.) Testing Requirements
Applicants to the Physician-Scientist Program should submit official scores from EITHER the SAT or the ACT.
The writing portion is NOT required for either exam.
Self-reported scores will not be accepted for accelerated program applicants.
