The five subcommittees are:The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This includes parents of current and prospective students, student applicants, incoming freshman, graduating seniors, and alumni/ae.Members of the Parents subcommittee serve as ambassadors for Rensselaer, reaching out in fellowship to these constituencies throughout the region. The subcommittee’s goal is to expand awareness of the unique and exceptional benefits of a Rensselaer education and collaborate with Student Life, Admissions, and Institute Advancement to support enrollment and retention efforts.Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists. To attract and retain the brightest and most promising candidates, we must have the financial resources to compete with other top-tier universities, including those able to meet the full financial needs of students.Increasing access and enhancing the student experience requires us to “bridge the gap” in available financial aid. To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience. The subcommittee will team with Graig Eastin, Vice President for Institute Advancement, and the Advancement team to connect alumni, corporations, foundations, friends, and parents to Rensselaer senior leadership and trustees committed to the pillars of Transformative: Campaign for Global Change for philanthropic opportunities.Rensselaer has a broad, collaborative, and vibrant research community, focused on the growing interface of the basic sciences, social sciences, and engineering. This provides the basis for innovative solutions to today’s global challenges, including preventing and mitigating disease; providing clean food and water; developing new sources of clean and renewable energy; and establishing a sustainable and resilient national and international infrastructure.The Research subcommittee will facilitate connections between Institute leadership and executives and leaders at prominent companies and foundations in the region in order to explore research partnerships, collaborations, and other potential opportunities. Members also will connect entrepreneurs seeking collaborations on startups and research projects with Rensselaer faculty, staff, and alumni/ae.Rensselaer exemplifies the critical importance and unquestionable value of women serving at the highest levels of leadership. No one better personifies this truth than President Shirley Ann Jackson, Ph.D. whose long list of personal and professional accomplishments are extraordinary.The Women’s Leadership subcommittee, in collaboration with Rensselaer leadership, will coordinate outreach to raise awareness about our commitment to recruiting more young women to attend Rensselaer, and encourage them to consider pursuing a STEM education. Committee members will also conduct outreach to companies and foundations in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area to make them aware of the caliber of young Rensselaer alumnae and to advocate for their recruitment.Jennifer TobinSenior Advancement Officer, Major GiftsOffice of Institute AdvancementRensselaer Polytechnic Institute(518) 276-3827 (p) | (518) 530-9916 (c) | Tobinj2@rpi.eduChasan Building

Each RSVN Executive Council member is asked to join one of five subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets twice per year and reports on its progress at the Council’s semi-annual meeting. The five subcommittees are: 











The Arch - (The position of Chair is currently open)

The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.







Parents – Chaired by Mrs. Adrienne Roberts, P'21

Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This includes parents of current and prospective students, student applicants, incoming freshman, graduating seniors, and alumni/ae.Members of the Parents subcommittee serve as ambassadors for Rensselaer, reaching out in fellowship to these constituencies throughout the region. The subcommittee’s goal is to expand awareness of the unique and exceptional benefits of a Rensselaer education and collaborate with Student Life, Admissions, and Institute Advancement to support enrollment and retention efforts.







Philanthropy (The position of Chair is currently open)

Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists. To attract and retain the brightest and most promising candidates, we must have the financial resources to compete with other top-tier universities, including those able to meet the full financial needs of students.Increasing access and enhancing the student experience requires us to “bridge the gap” in available financial aid. To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience. The subcommittee will team with Graig Eastin, Vice President for Institute Advancement, and the Advancement team to connect alumni, corporations, foundations, friends, and parents to Rensselaer senior leadership and trustees committed to the pillars of Transformative: Campaign for Global Change for philanthropic opportunities.







Fostering Research & Technical Collaborations (The position of Chair is currently open)

Rensselaer has a broad, collaborative, and vibrant research community, focused on the growing interface of the basic sciences, social sciences, and engineering. This provides the basis for innovative solutions to today’s global challenges, including preventing and mitigating disease; providing clean food and water; developing new sources of clean and renewable energy; and establishing a sustainable and resilient national and international infrastructure.The Research subcommittee will facilitate connections between Institute leadership and executives and leaders at prominent companies and foundations in the region in order to explore research partnerships, collaborations, and other potential opportunities. Members also will connect entrepreneurs seeking collaborations on startups and research projects with Rensselaer faculty, staff, and alumni/ae.







Women’s Leadership - Chaired by Cheryl Porro ’93

Rensselaer exemplifies the critical importance and unquestionable value of women serving at the highest levels of leadership. No one better personifies this truth than President Shirley Ann Jackson, Ph.D. whose long list of personal and professional accomplishments are extraordinary.The Women’s Leadership subcommittee, in collaboration with Rensselaer leadership, will coordinate outreach to raise awareness about our commitment to recruiting more young women to attend Rensselaer, and encourage them to consider pursuing a STEM education. Committee members will also conduct outreach to companies and foundations in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area to make them aware of the caliber of young Rensselaer alumnae and to advocate for their recruitment.

RENSSELAER SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
SUBCOMMITTEES 




Each RSVN Executive Council member is asked to join one of five subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets twice per year and reports on its progress at the Council’s semi-annual meeting. The five subcommittees are: 











The Arch - (The position of Chair is currently open)

The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.







Parents – Chaired by Mrs. Adrienne Roberts, P'21

Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This includes parents of current and prospective students, student applicants, incoming freshman, graduating seniors, and alumni/ae.Members of the Parents subcommittee serve as ambassadors for Rensselaer, reaching out in fellowship to these constituencies throughout the region. The subcommittee’s goal is to expand awareness of the unique and exceptional benefits of a Rensselaer education and collaborate with Student Life, Admissions, and Institute Advancement to support enrollment and retention efforts.







Philanthropy (The position of Chair is currently open)

Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists. To attract and retain the brightest and most promising candidates, we must have the financial resources to compete with other top-tier universities, including those able to meet the full financial needs of students.Increasing access and enhancing the student experience requires us to “bridge the gap” in available financial aid. To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience. The subcommittee will team with Graig Eastin, Vice President for Institute Advancement, and the Advancement team to connect alumni, corporations, foundations, friends, and parents to Rensselaer senior leadership and trustees committed to the pillars of Transformative: Campaign for Global Change for philanthropic opportunities.







Fostering Research & Technical Collaborations (The position of Chair is currently open)

Rensselaer has a broad, collaborative, and vibrant research community, focused on the growing interface of the basic sciences, social sciences, and engineering. This provides the basis for innovative solutions to today’s global challenges, including preventing and mitigating disease; providing clean food and water; developing new sources of clean and renewable energy; and establishing a sustainable and resilient national and international infrastructure.The Research subcommittee will facilitate connections between Institute leadership and executives and leaders at prominent companies and foundations in the region in order to explore research partnerships, collaborations, and other potential opportunities. Members also will connect entrepreneurs seeking collaborations on startups and research projects with Rensselaer faculty, staff, and alumni/ae.







Women’s Leadership - Chaired by Cheryl Porro ’93

RENSSELAER SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
SUBCOMMITTEES 




Each RSVN Executive Council member is asked to join one of five subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets twice per year and reports on its progress at the Council’s semi-annual meeting. The five subcommittees are: 











The Arch - (The position of Chair is currently open)

The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.







Parents – Chaired by Mrs. Adrienne Roberts, P'21

Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This includes parents of current and prospective students, student applicants, incoming freshman, graduating seniors, and alumni/ae.Members of the Parents subcommittee serve as ambassadors for Rensselaer, reaching out in fellowship to these constituencies throughout the region. The subcommittee’s goal is to expand awareness of the unique and exceptional benefits of a Rensselaer education and collaborate with Student Life, Admissions, and Institute Advancement to support enrollment and retention efforts.







Philanthropy (The position of Chair is currently open)

Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists. To attract and retain the brightest and most promising candidates, we must have the financial resources to compete with other top-tier universities, including those able to meet the full financial needs of students.Increasing access and enhancing the student experience requires us to “bridge the gap” in available financial aid. To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience. The subcommittee will team with Graig Eastin, Vice President for Institute Advancement, and the Advancement team to connect alumni, corporations, foundations, friends, and parents to Rensselaer senior leadership and trustees committed to the pillars of Transformative: Campaign for Global Change for philanthropic opportunities.







Fostering Research & Technical Collaborations (The position of Chair is currently open)

Rensselaer has a broad, collaborative, and vibrant research community, focused on the growing interface of the basic sciences, social sciences, and engineering. This provides the basis for innovative solutions to today’s global challenges, including preventing and mitigating disease; providing clean food and water; developing new sources of clean and renewable energy; and establishing a sustainable and resilient national and international infrastructure.The Research subcommittee will facilitate connections between Institute leadership and executives and leaders at prominent companies and foundations in the region in order to explore research partnerships, collaborations, and other potential opportunities. Members also will connect entrepreneurs seeking collaborations on startups and research projects with Rensselaer faculty, staff, and alumni/ae.







Women’s Leadership - Chaired by Cheryl Porro ’93

RENSSELAER SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
SUBCOMMITTEES 




Each RSVN Executive Council member is asked to join one of five subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets twice per year and reports on its progress at the Council’s semi-annual meeting. The five subcommittees are: 











The Arch - (The position of Chair is currently open)

The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.







Parents – Chaired by Mrs. Adrienne Roberts, P'21

Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.

Philanthropy (The position of Chair is currently open)

Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists. To attract and retain the brightest and most promising candidates, we must have the financial resources to compete with other top-tier universities, including those able to meet the full financial needs of students.Increasing access and enhancing the student experience requires us to “bridge the gap” in available financial aid. To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience. The subcommittee will team with Graig Eastin, Vice President for Institute Advancement, and the Advancement team to connect alumni, corporations, foundations, friends, and parents to Rensselaer senior leadership and trustees committed to the pillars of Transformative: Campaign for Global Change for philanthropic opportunities.

Members also will connect entrepreneurs seeking collaborations on startups and research projects with Rensselaer faculty, staff, and alumni/ae.







Women’s Leadership - Chaired by Cheryl Porro ’93

RENSSELAER SILICON VALLEY EXECUTIVE COUNCIL
SUBCOMMITTEES 




Each RSVN Executive Council member is asked to join one of five subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets twice per year and reports on its progress at the Council’s semi-annual meeting. The five subcommittees are: 











The Arch - (The position of Chair is currently open)

The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.







Parents – Chaired by Mrs. Adrienne Roberts, P'21

Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This includes parents of current and prospective students, student applicants, incoming freshman, graduating seniors, and alumni/ae.Members of the Parents subcommittee serve as ambassadors for Rensselaer, reaching out in fellowship to these constituencies throughout the region. The subcommittee’s goal is to expand awareness of the unique and exceptional benefits of a Rensselaer education and collaborate with Student Life, Admissions, and Institute Advancement to support enrollment and retention efforts.







Philanthropy (The position of Chair is currently open)

Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists. To attract and retain the brightest and most promising candidates, we must have the financial resources to compete with other top-tier universities, including those able to meet the full financial needs of students.Increasing access and enhancing the student experience requires us to “bridge the gap” in available financial aid. To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience.

Each RSVN Executive Council member is asked to join one of five subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets twice per year and reports on its progress at the Council’s semi-annual meeting. The five subcommittees are: 











The Arch - (The position of Chair is currently open)

The Arch is a unique program that provides flexibility in the junior-year semester. It enables students to pursue professional and personal development opportunities that prepare them to meet the multi-faceted challenges of the 21stcentury, and still graduate on time.Rising juniors remain on campus after their sophomore year to attend a full academic summer semester taking junior-level classes while receiving focused attention from faculty, staff, and administrators.After completing junior year courses during the summer semester, students starting internships or co-ops are more fully prepared to tackle the discipline-specific assignments that await them. The subcommittee will team with the Center for Career and Professional Development at Rensselaer to help expand placement of students at companies and organizations throughout Silicon Valley and the Bay Area.







Parents – Chaired by Mrs. Adrienne Roberts, P'21

Rensselaer parents are critical to sharing information and providing forums to encourage the engagement and participation of the community in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This includes parents of current and prospective students, student applicants, incoming freshman, graduating seniors, and alumni/ae.Members of the Parents subcommittee serve as ambassadors for Rensselaer, reaching out in fellowship to these constituencies throughout the region.

Philanthropy (The position of Chair is currently open)

Students are more than our first priority—they are the reason Rensselaer exists.

To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community.We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience.

Committee members will also conduct outreach to companies and foundations in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area to make them aware of the caliber of young Rensselaer alumnae and to advocate for their recruitment.
