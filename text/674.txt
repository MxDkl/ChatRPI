Residencies


Artist production residencies are the heart of the curatorial program at EMPAC. Much of the work that we commission and present is developed through residencies in collaboration with our curatorial and production staff. Artists benefit from unparalleled access to state-of-the-art technological infrastructure for the making of their work, including support from EMPAC’s expert team of video, audio, stage and production engineers and technicians. Residencies are often planned years in advance to afford time for extended engagement between artists and our staff. The number of residencies, their structure and length is tailored to each individual artist and project.
Open Call Programs
EMPAC has partnered with the Australia Council for the Arts and the Flemish Government’s Department of Culture, Youth and Media to provide residency support for artists. The curators work with staff from each organization to select projects from yearly open calls by and to those institutions. Information on eligibility, deadlines, and how to apply can be found at the participating organization’s website:
Flemish Government, Department of Culture, Youth, and Media

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic EMPAC is currently closed to the public and our general open call residency program is on hold. We are not accepting general open call applications at this time.

Residencies


Artist production residencies are the heart of the curatorial program at EMPAC. Much of the work that we commission and present is developed through residencies in collaboration with our curatorial and production staff. Artists benefit from unparalleled access to state-of-the-art technological infrastructure for the making of their work, including support from EMPAC’s expert team of video, audio, stage and production engineers and technicians. Residencies are often planned years in advance to afford time for extended engagement between artists and our staff. The number of residencies, their structure and length is tailored to each individual artist and project.
Open Call Programs
EMPAC has partnered with the Australia Council for the Arts and the Flemish Government’s Department of Culture, Youth and Media to provide residency support for artists. The curators work with staff from each organization to select projects from yearly open calls by and to those institutions. Information on eligibility, deadlines, and how to apply can be found at the participating organization’s website:
Flemish Government, Department of Culture, Youth, and Media

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic EMPAC is currently closed to the public and our general open call residency program is on hold. We are not accepting general open call applications at this time.

Residencies


Artist production residencies are the heart of the curatorial program at EMPAC. Much of the work that we commission and present is developed through residencies in collaboration with our curatorial and production staff. Artists benefit from unparalleled access to state-of-the-art technological infrastructure for the making of their work, including support from EMPAC’s expert team of video, audio, stage and production engineers and technicians. Residencies are often planned years in advance to afford time for extended engagement between artists and our staff. The number of residencies, their structure and length is tailored to each individual artist and project.
Open Call Programs
EMPAC has partnered with the Australia Council for the Arts and the Flemish Government’s Department of Culture, Youth and Media to provide residency support for artists. The curators work with staff from each organization to select projects from yearly open calls by and to those institutions. Information on eligibility, deadlines, and how to apply can be found at the participating organization’s website:
Flemish Government, Department of Culture, Youth, and Media

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic EMPAC is currently closed to the public and our general open call residency program is on hold. We are not accepting general open call applications at this time.

Artist production residencies are the heart of the curatorial program at EMPAC. Much of the work that we commission and present is developed through residencies in collaboration with our curatorial and production staff. Artists benefit from unparalleled access to state-of-the-art technological infrastructure for the making of their work, including support from EMPAC’s expert team of video, audio, stage and production engineers and technicians. Residencies are often planned years in advance to afford time for extended engagement between artists and our staff. The number of residencies, their structure and length is tailored to each individual artist and project.
Open Call Programs
EMPAC has partnered with the Australia Council for the Arts and the Flemish Government’s Department of Culture, Youth and Media to provide residency support for artists. The curators work with staff from each organization to select projects from yearly open calls by and to those institutions. Information on eligibility, deadlines, and how to apply can be found at the participating organization’s website:
Flemish Government, Department of Culture, Youth, and Media

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic EMPAC is currently closed to the public and our general open call residency program is on hold. We are not accepting general open call applications at this time.
