     Frequently Asked Questions     





      How many freshmen arrive each spring?
Approximately 80-100 first-year students begin their Rensselaer experience in the spring semester.
 





      Is being admitted for the spring term like being placed on the waiting list?
No, being admitted for spring is an acceptance to Rensselaer. Students who are offered spring admission are guaranteed a spot at Rensselaer to begin in the spring; students placed on the wait list for the fall semester are not guaranteed a spot at Rensselaer. 
 





      If I accept an offer of Spring Admission, will I graduate on time?
The majority of students entering in the spring will graduate with their class. This can be accomplished by taking classes elsewhere before enrolling at Rensselaer, obtaining AP/IB credit from high school, taking summer courses before enrolling or in subsequent summers, or some combination of all of these options. 
 





      What do students starting in the spring term do during the fall?
Students electing to enroll in the spring use the fall semester to pursue a wide range of interests. Some students elect to take courses at other colleges; others engage in internships, volunteer work, outdoor exploration, or paid employment.  
 





      If I decide to take courses at another institution in the fall, will I receive credit at Rensselaer?
Any course taken at a two-year or four-year institution will be reviewed by the Rensselaer faculty for its transferability. Students enrolling in the spring are encouraged to work with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to design a fall schedule that is both appropriate for and transferable into their intended course of study at Rensselaer. 
You can see the classes that have transferred in the past at http://go.rpi.edu/creditguide. All other classes can be pre-approved by submitting course information and course descriptions to the Admissions Office. Official college transcript(s) will need to be submitted to the Registrar’s Office upon completion of the course(s).
 





      What support is provided to students who begin in the spring?
All students and their families will be provided with an orientation experience designed specifically for them by the Office of the First-Year Experience and will be quickly incorporated into the student community at the start of the spring semester.
The Advising and Learning Assistance Center is a place where students can get “one-stop” academic support in the form of services and programs designed to help them achieve their goals by becoming more effective and efficient learners. The center coordinates advising, counsels individual students, and offers free tutoring and workshops.
If you have a learning disability, physical disability, or emotional/psychological disability, we encourage you to contact Disability Services for Students to learn about available assistance.
 





      Will on-campus housing be available?
Incoming freshmen starting in the spring will be required to live on-campus for their first four semesters, including their Arch summer semester; therefore, housing is guaranteed.
 





      How will I select my spring classes?
Students starting in the spring will be assigned an academic adviser who will work with them remotely during the fall semester to determine appropriate course selection and prepare for registration.

      If I decide to take courses at another institution in the fall, will I receive credit at Rensselaer?
Any course taken at a two-year or four-year institution will be reviewed by the Rensselaer faculty for its transferability. Students enrolling in the spring are encouraged to work with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to design a fall schedule that is both appropriate for and transferable into their intended course of study at Rensselaer. 
You can see the classes that have transferred in the past at http://go.rpi.edu/creditguide. All other classes can be pre-approved by submitting course information and course descriptions to the Admissions Office. Official college transcript(s) will need to be submitted to the Registrar’s Office upon completion of the course(s).
 





      What support is provided to students who begin in the spring?
All students and their families will be provided with an orientation experience designed specifically for them by the Office of the First-Year Experience and will be quickly incorporated into the student community at the start of the spring semester.
The Advising and Learning Assistance Center is a place where students can get “one-stop” academic support in the form of services and programs designed to help them achieve their goals by becoming more effective and efficient learners. The center coordinates advising, counsels individual students, and offers free tutoring and workshops.
If you have a learning disability, physical disability, or emotional/psychological disability, we encourage you to contact Disability Services for Students to learn about available assistance.
 





      Will on-campus housing be available?
Incoming freshmen starting in the spring will be required to live on-campus for their first four semesters, including their Arch summer semester; therefore, housing is guaranteed.
 





      How will I select my spring classes?
Students starting in the spring will be assigned an academic adviser who will work with them remotely during the fall semester to determine appropriate course selection and prepare for registration.
 

 

 



 

 


Spring Admission






Although Rensselaer would love to admit all of our qualified applicants for the fall, due to space limitations, we are only able to admit a select number of students. Since more students take advantage of off-campus opportunities, such as study abroad and co-ops during the spring semester, additional openings are created midyear. In an effort to give an opportunity to as many deserving students as possible, the Spring Admission program was created.
