Biomedical engineers work with cutting-edge technologies to tackle grand challenges related to the application of engineering principles to human physiology. They advance human health, engineer better medicines, and create the tools of innovation and scientific discovery by designing solutions to problems at the interface of biology, medicine, and engineering.From the wheelchair that helps people stay mobile to the pain-relievers in their medicine cabinets to the x-ray that tells them whether they can play in the next big game, the products developed by biomedical engineers fit seamlessly into humans’ everyday modern lives.  Some biomedical engineers design innovative tools and devices (such as prosthetics and imaging machines) to aid medical care, while others work to improve the processes of health care delivery (through new drug therapies, for example). Biomedical engineers also study signals generated by organs such as the heart and brain in order to understand how the body functions and how biological systems work. Many build artificial organs, limbs, and valves to replace failing tissues. Biomedical engineers are involved in rehabilitation by improving the designs of therapeutic devices to increase performance.Whether designing and evaluating new technologies, developing new methods of patient care, or studying biological processes, biomedical engineers are focused on improving the quality of people’s lives.At Rensselaer, the BME curriculum combines significant life science content with engineering and basic science courses. Undergraduate BME students can select one of three offered concentrations (biomaterials, biomechanics, bioimaging/instrumentation) and also have the option of combining these with a pre-med or a management minor as well as the standard BME curriculum. Graduate studies include a significant research component under the direction of a faculty supervisor.AboutResearchAcademicsStudentsNews & EventsContactAboutResearchAcademicsStudentsNews & EventsContactHomeAcademicsDepartmentsBiomedical Engineering21st Century Technological EducationDepartments & ProgramsFacultyOutreachTeaching OpportunitiesAboutResearchAcademicsStudentsNews & EventsContact
