Music majors and minors may apply the credit earned in the Private Music Lessons Program to their degrees. Non-majors or minors can participate in this program as part of their HASS elective coursework. The HASS core curriculum’s “integrated pathways” include a music performance option, which also can be fulfilled through the credit earned from taking private lessons.Lessons are taught by part-time instructors employed as “Faculty Fellows” who deliver one-on-one instruction in violin, viola, cello, bass, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, trumpet, French horn, trombone, tuba, piano, harp, percussion, voice, guitar, and jazz improvisation. These Faculty Fellows are recruited from the ranks of leading music professionals in the Capital District. Approximately 50 students participate in the program per semester for 50-minute sessions each week.Students are typically assessed in end-of-semester juries, and evaluated on the basis of their diligence, improvement, and creativity. On occasion, showcase concerts are presented in the Experimental Media and Performing Art Center (EMPAC).Chasan Building
