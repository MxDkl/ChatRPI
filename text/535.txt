     FAQs     





      Are there any minimum grade requirements for the renewal of Rensselaer merit- or need-based scholarships?
No, there is no academic requirement for renewal.
 





      My parents are separated/divorced. What do I report on my application?
You are required to report the income of the parent you lived with most in the last 12 months on your FAFSA and Profile applications, as well as any stepparent’s income and assets. Child support from the other parent, together with the income and assets of the parent with whom you live, will determine your need. We do not require the CSS Profile non-custodial parent form.
 





      What happens if my family's financial situation changes after I file my form?
If there is a change in your family’s financial situation after you complete and submit your FAFSA/CSS Profile, call or write directly to Rensselaer's Office of Financial Aid.
 





      If I am a Rensselaer scholarship award recipient and I subsequently receive outside awards, will you reduce my Rensselaer scholarship assistance?
Not usually. Students are allowed to keep any outside awards in addition to their Rensselaer scholarship awards, as long as the total does not exceed our cost of attendance. Need-based awards are subject to change in the following order: loans, federal work-study, and finally, grants.
