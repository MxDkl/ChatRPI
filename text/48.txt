To be a magnet for the best and brightest students and faculty, our living and recreation spaces, academic facilities, and research centers must be state-of-the-art and contribute to a vibrant and engaged campus community. We are engaged in major infrastructure projects that will dramatically enhance our capabilities and the student experience.The Center for Science will facilitate the fluid exchange of ideas by bringing Rensselaer scientists together into advanced laboratories, research, and teaching spaces.The expansion of the East Campus Athletic Village will promote a healthy living and learning environment, and enable Rensselaer to host regional, national, and international athletes for exhibitions and tournaments.A reimagined Music Center, with practice rooms and teaching studios, will be configured in West Hall, while an infusion of the latest technology into the Media Studios in the Darrin Communications Center will ensure the highest levels of production quality. These are all in support of our new B.S. in Music degree, that promises to keep Rensselaer at the forefront of cross-disciplinary inquiry in the arts and sciences.Taken together, these new facilities will invigorate Rensselaer athletics and arts, enhance our student clubs and organizations, and fuel greater social and intellectual engagement.
